# ~GAME OF LIFE~ **_Turbo_ GOL**

## Purpose of this project :
I want to learn how to use REACT with a little project, and I really really wanted to build a game of life when I started to learn coding. So here I am. Six in the morning, listening good music and achieving dreams. I guess it will be the sloppiest _gol_ the world would ever carry, but I am very proud of how much I have learned so far, and amazed by how mush is left for me to learn. XOXO

## What is left to do :
* See how to display this time based Game and handling infinite runs, and limits of the board
* Set up of the board is over (I think) and we need to start the real juice : the actual Game :
  * Add a button to run it
  * Add the logic to run it
  * Fix bugs that will emerge
* Polishing :
  * Ability to choose the size of the board
  * Color palette
  * Memes.
